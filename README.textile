h2. Overview

*Clever Algorithms: Statistical Machine Learning Recipes* is an open source book that has the goal to describe a large number of algorithmic techniques from the the field of statistical machine learning in a complete, consistent, and centralized manner such that they are accessible, usable, and understandable. This is a repository for the book project used during the development and ongoing maintenance of the books' content.

The book will be released for free on the website "CleverAlgorithms.com":http://cleveralgorithms.com and will be available for purchase as a paperback and ebook.

h3. Blurb

bq. Implementing an Machine Learning algorithms is difficult. Algorithm descriptions may be incomplete, inconsistent, and distributed across a number of papers, chapters and even websites. This can result in varied interpretations of algorithms, undue attrition of algorithms, and ultimately bad science. This book is an effort to address these issues by providing a handbook of algorithmic recipes drawn from the field of Machine Learning, described in a complete, consistent, and centralized manner. These standardized descriptions were carefully designed to be accessible, usable, and understandable. An encyclopedic algorithm reference, this book is intended for research scientists, engineers, students, and interested amateurs. Each algorithm description provides a working code example in R.

h3. How to Build

# Assumes a Linux or Mac workstation with make, Latex such as "TeXLive":http://www.tug.org/texlive/ or "MacTex":http://www.tug.org/mactex/ installed and maybe "JabRef":http://jabref.sourceforge.net/ 
# <code>git clone git@github.com:jbrownlee/CleverAlgorithmsMachineLearning.git</code>
# @cd CleverAlgorithmsMachineLearning@
# @make r@ (creates the file @book/book.pdf@)
# @make vl@ (to view the PDF on linux) or @make vm@ (to view the PDF on mac)
