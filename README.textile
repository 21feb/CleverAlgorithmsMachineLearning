h1. Clever Algorithms: Statistical Machine Learning Recipes 

h2. Overview

This project is an effort to describe a large number of algorithmic techniques from the the field of Machine Learning in a complete, consistent, and centralized manner such that they are accessible, usable, and understandable. 

The Clever Algorithms project is currently hosted online at "http://www.CleverAlgorithms.com":http://www.CleverAlgorithms.com 

This is a repository for the project for hosting, versioning and collaboration, used during the development of the content for deliverables (website and book), as well as for the ongoing maintenance of the outcomes from the project.
