h1. Clever Algorithms: Statistical Machine Learning Recipes 

h2. Overview

The Clever Algorithms: Machine Learning project is an effort to describe a large number of algorithmic techniques from the the field of Machine Learning in a complete, consistent, and centralized manner such that they are accessible, usable, and understandable. 

The Clever Algorithms project is currently hosted online at "http://www.CleverAlgorithms.com":http://www.CleverAlgorithms.com 

This is a repository for the Clever Algorithms: Machine Learning project for hosting, versioning and collaboration, used during the development of the content for deliverables (website and book), as well as for the ongoing maintenance of the outcomes from the project.

h2. Contribute

Found a typo in some content or a bug in the source code? Are you an expert in a given area and know some facts that could improve an algorithm description for all? Do you want to get that warm feeling from contributing to an open source project? Do you want to see your name as an acknowledgment in print?

Two pillars of this effort are i) that the best domain experts are people outside of the project, and ii) that this work is subjected to continuous improvement. 

*Please help to make this work less wrong!*

You may want to:
* Email the author: "jasonb@CleverAlgorithms.com":mailto:jasonb@CleverAlgorithms.com
* Fork the project on github, make changes, and request a pull into the main project (again, you must signup and login to github and follow the github documentation for forking, contributing, and making a pull request).

Why would I release all of the work product from this project under a permissive license? Because I agree with "Tim O'Reilly":http://openp2p.com/lpt/a/3015 that "_obscurity is a far greater threat to authors and creative artists than piracy_". It is more important to me that the outcomes of this project are read and used than be treated as a revenue generating commodity.
