% other names
% What is the canonical name and common aliases for a technique?
% What are the common abbreviations and acronyms for a technique?
\emph{K-means, Kmeans.}

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
K-means is a clustering algorithm.

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.

\subsection{Code Listing}
% listing
Listing~\ref{stats_kmeans} provides a code listing of the K-Means clustering method in R to identify cluster centres in a two-dimensional dataset.
% algorithm and package
The example uses the \texttt{kmeans()} function in the \texttt{stats} core package.
% TODO more about the package and the functions capabilities

% problem
The test problem is a two-dimensional dataset, where the $x$ and $y$ attributes are numerical and drawn from normal distributions around 0 and 4.
