% What is the canonical name and common aliases for a technique?
% What are the common abbreviations and acronyms for a technique?
\emph{Principle Component Analysis, PCA.}

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
Principle Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction method.

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.

\subsection{Code Listing}
% listing
Listing~\ref{stats_principal_component_analysis} provides a code listing of the Principle Component Analysis method in R.
% algorithm and package
The example uses the \texttt{prcomp()} function in the \texttt{stats} core package which is based on \texttt{svd()}.
% TODO more about the package and the functions capabilities

% problem
The test problem is a three-dimensional dataset, where the $x$, $y$ and $z$ attributes are numerical and drawn from normal distributions with different means. 

% TODO use a sample problem with textual labels

% other packages
The \texttt{stats} package also provides the \texttt{princomp} which is based on \texttt{eigen()} and \texttt{cmdscale} functions for computing a PCA.

% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is suggested.
