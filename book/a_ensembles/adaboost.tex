\emph{AdaBoost, AdaBoost.M1}

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
AdaBoost is an Ensemble algorithm.

boosting is sometimes called leverage - leveraging algorithms

AdaBoost.M1 is the classical algorithm
AdaBoost.M2
AdaBoost.R
AdaBoost.R2
Fast AdaBoost


Friends: LPBoost, TotalBoost, BrownBoost, MadaBoost, LogitBoost
AnyBoost framework

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\subsection{Strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
% What is a techniques plan of action?

all about one learner learning the weaknesses of another learner - continue until a desired level of performance is achieved

statistical view: stage-wise gradient descent that minimizing an exponetial loss function

adaboost was one of the first boosting algorithms that could adapt its weak learners

\subsection{Overview}

% what it is good at
\subsubsection{Features}

\begin{itemize}
	\item It is very difficult for AdaBoost to overfit a training dataset. This feature is highlighted as a limitation of the statistical view of the approach given that it cannot explain how this is the case \cite{Mease2008}.
\end{itemize}

% what it is not good at
\subsubsection{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cannot handle noisy data? \cite{Long2010}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code Listing}



the \texttt{adabag} package provides the Adaboost.M1 algorithm \cite{Cortes2011}

the \texttt{gbm} package implements extensions to the Adaboost algorithm - uses an exponential loss function, also uses gradient descent to train it  \cite{Ridgeway2007a}

the \texttt{ada} packge provides Adaboost, Gentle Adaboost, and Real Adaboost. Also regularized versions of these algorithms. based on rpart.

% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is suggested.
