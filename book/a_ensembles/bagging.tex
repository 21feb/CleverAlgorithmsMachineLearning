% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
Bootstrapped Aggregation (Bagging) is an Ensemble algorithm.

Bagging is a special case of Stagewise Additive Modeling - General Forward Stagewise Additive Modeling


% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\subsection{Strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
% What is a techniques plan of action

a variance reduction technique
 each partition is an iid

partition data into random subsets, with replacement - called bootstrap replicates
train a model on each partition
average the results

not suited to all models - not good for svm
svm variance is not high

\subsection{Code Listing}
% listing
Listing~\ref{ipred_bagging} provides a code listing of the Bagging algorithm in R.
% algorithm and package
The example uses the \texttt{bagging()} function in the \texttt{ipred} package \cite{Peters2011} that provides bootstrap aggregation with trees via the \texttt{rpart()} of the \texttt{rpart} package.
% TODO more about the package and the functions capabilities
Peters, et al. also provide a vignette of the \texttt{ipred} package with more examples and references \cite{Peters2011a}.

% problem
The test problem is a three-dimensional dataset, where the $x$, $y$ and $z$ attributes are numerical and drawn from normal distributions with different means. The objective is to predict the categorical dependent $z$ given the independents $x$ and $y$.

% other packages
Other packages provide an implementation of the bagging algorithm including the \texttt{adabag} package \cite{Cortes2011}, the \texttt{ada} package that only provides binary classification, and the \texttt{caret} package provides a framework for bagging \cite{Kuhn2011}.

% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is suggested.
