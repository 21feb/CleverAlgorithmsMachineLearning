% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.

\subsection{Code Listing}
% listing
Listing~\ref{gbm_gradient_boosting} provides a code listing of the Gradient Boosting algorithm in R.
% algorithm and package
The example uses the \texttt{gbm()} function in the \texttt{gbm} package \cite{Ridgeway2007a}. The \texttt{gbm()} function makes use of the \texttt{rpart()} function from the \texttt{rpart} package to create an ensemble of trees as the weak learners.
% TODO more about the package and the functions capabilities
Ridgeway also provides a vignette of the \texttt{gbm} package with more examples and references \cite{Ridgeway2007}.

% problem
The test problem is a three-dimensional dataset, where the $x$, $y$ and $z$ attributes are numerical and drawn from normal distributions with different means. The objective is to predict the categorical dependent $z$ given the independents $x$ and $y$.
