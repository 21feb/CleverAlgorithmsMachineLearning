% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
Support Vector Machines are a kernel method.

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\subsection{Strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
% What is a techniques plan of action?

try to create a classifier directly, not a probability of a class like logit
find hyper plane that maximizes the margin
only works if the training data is separable
it is a linear classifier
support points... boundary of the margin

use soft margin if the data is not linearly separable - budget of max overlap allowed
budget - a regularization parameter

basis transformations - increase dimensions using polynominals
- use both soft margin and more dimensions

radial basis svm...
gamma is like the steepness of the kernel

use crossvalidation to refine the parameter - b
algorithm for finding best for all values of b
regularization

\subsection{Code Listing}
% listing
Listing~\ref{e1071_support_vector_machines} provides a code listing of the Support Vector Machines algorithm in R to classify examples from a three-dimensional dataset.
% algorithm and package
The example uses the \texttt{svm()} function in the \texttt{e1071} package \cite{Meyer2011}.
% TODO more about the package and libsvm

% problem
The test problem is a three-dimensional classification problem, where the $x$ and $y$ attributes are numerical and drawn from normal distributions around 0 and 4. A class value of 0 or 1 is assigned to each coordinate such that the two classes can be separated by a straight line. The dataset is split into a training set to make the model comprised of 67\% of the samples, and a test set for assessing the model comprised of 33\% of the samples.

% other packages
Karatzoglou, Meyer, and Hornik provide a comprehensive overview of the R packages that provide SVM implementations, providing a summary of the capabilities and script examplse of each \cite{Karatzoglou2006}.
