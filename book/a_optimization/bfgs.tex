\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
BFGS is an optimization method for multidimensional nonlinear unconstrained functions.
BFGS belongs to the family of Quasi-Newton (Variable Metric) optimization methods that seek a stationary point in a function where the gradient is zero.

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.

Don't need to select a learning rate?
it is a quasi-Newton method (variable metric algorithm)
uses function values and gradients to understand the surface being optimization

BFGS is a Quasi-Newton method that normally require second derivatives to be computed directly, although BFGS is able to make approximations.

\end{itemize}

% what it is not good at
\subsubsection{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Requires a relatively large memory footprint, as it maintains an $n*n$ Hessian matrix, where $n$ is the number of variables.

\subsection{Code Listing}
% listing
Listing~\ref{stats_bfgs} provides a code listing of the BFGS method in R solving a two-dimensional nonlinear unconstrained optimization function.
% algorithm and package
The example uses the {optim()} function in the \texttt{stats} core package configured to use the BFGS method. For more information on the function, type \texttt{?optim}.
% problem
The test problem is the Rosenbrock function in two-dimensions where the optimum is at $x=1, y=1$. The starting position for the algorithm is taken as a random point $x,y \in [-3,3]$. The gradient for this function is specified and is used by the optimization method.

% TODO consider capturing algorithm progression (using par)

% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is suggested.
