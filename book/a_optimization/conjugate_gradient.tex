% other names
% What is the canonical name and common aliases for a technique?
% What are the common abbreviations and acronyms for a technique?
\emph{Conjugate Gradient Method.}

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
Conjugate Gradient Method is a first-order derivative optimization method for multidimensional nonlinear unconstrained functions.
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
It is related to other first-order derivative optimization algorithms such as Gradient Descent and Steepest Descent.


% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\subsection{Strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
% What is a techniques plan of action?

Uses conjugate directions rather than local gradients to move downhill towards the function minima. 

% Does it use a line search for alpha?

% help me use this technique
\subsection{Overview}

% what it is good at
\subsubsection{Features}

\begin{itemize}
	\item A learning rate does not need to be specified.
	\item Does not store a matrix (like BFGS) and there fore may be successful (less memory) on larger problems? (verify?)
\end{itemize}

% what it is not good at
\subsubsection{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
	\item More fragile than BFGS? (verify?)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code Listing}
% listing
Listing~\ref{stats_conjugate_gradient} provides a code listing of the Conjugate Gradient method in R solving a two-dimensional nonlinear unconstrained optimization function.
% algorithm and package
The example uses the {optim()} function in the \texttt{stats} core package configured to use the Conjugate Gradient method as ``CG''. The method supports three update methods: Fletcher-Reeves update (default), Polak-Ribiere update, and Beale-Sorenson update. For more information on the function, type \texttt{?optim}.
% problem
The test problem is the Rosenbrock function in two-dimensions where the optimum is at $x=1, y=1$. The starting position for the algorithm is taken as a random point $x,y \in [-3,3]$.  The gradient for this function is specified and is used by the optimization method.

% TODO consider capturing algorithm progression (using par)
