\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
Gradient Descent is an optimization method for unconstrained nonlinear optimization.

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.

\subsection{Code Listing}
% listing
Listing~\ref{stats_gradient_descent} provides a code listing Gradient Descent method in R solving a one-dimensional nonlinear unconstrained optimization function.
% algorithm and package
The example uses the {optimize()} function in the \texttt{stats} core package which is limited to one-dimensional function. 
% problem
The test problem is the basin function in one-dimension where the optimum is at $f(0)=0$ and the domain is defined as $x \in [-5,5]$. 

% what is the starting position?
% what is the method implemented in this function exactly?
