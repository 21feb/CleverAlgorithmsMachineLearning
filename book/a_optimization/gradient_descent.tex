% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
Gradient Descent is an optimization method for unconstrained nonlinear optimization.
It is a direct search method that does require a differentiable function for a gradient, instead it infers the gradient from sampling.
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique? 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (Online Gradient Descent) is an extension commonly used to train a classification or regression model where the gradient is a cost or loss function and the next step is recomputed with each new observation or defined set of observations.


% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.

% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is suggested.
