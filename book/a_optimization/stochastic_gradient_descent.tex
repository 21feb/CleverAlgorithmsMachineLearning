% other names
% What is the canonical name and common aliases for a technique?
% What are the common abbreviations and acronyms for a technique?
\emph{Stochastic Gradient Descent.}

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
Stochastic Gradient Descent is an optimization method for unconstrained nonlinear optimization.

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
