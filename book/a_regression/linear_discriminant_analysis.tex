\emph{Linear Discriminant Analysis, Discriminant Analysis, Discriminant Function Analysis, Linear Discriminant Function, LDA.}

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
Linear Discriminant Analysis is a classification method.

Used for classification and for dimensionality reduction.

What is Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis?

How is it related to Quadratic Discriminant Analysis?
Factor Analysis?
PCA
Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis?
Kernel Discriminant Analysis?

Related to linear regression which provides a linear model for a numeric rather than categorical.


% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\subsection{Strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
% What is a techniques plan of action?

used for classification and dimensionality reduction
kind of like regression
linear model for a nominal (categorical) dependent variable.

% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is suggested.
