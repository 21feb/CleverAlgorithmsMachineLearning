% What is the canonical name and common aliases for a technique?
% What are the common abbreviations and acronyms for a technique?
\emph{Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, MARS, MARSplines, Adaptive Regression Splines.}

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines is a Multivariate Non-Parametric Regression method.
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
It is related to other Non-Parametric Regression methods such as Kernel Regression, Non-Parametric Multiplicative Regression, Additive Modelling and Regression Trees.
% extensions
Fast MARS in an extension of the canonical MARS method. % ref?
% PolyMars

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\subsection{Strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
% What is a techniques plan of action?

model is an expansion in product spline basis functions

the number of basis functions as well as the parameters for each are determined determined automatically based on the data

automatic: variable selection, variable transformation, interaction detection, self testing,

inspired by recursive partitioning and shares the attractive properties of that model
provides a continuous model 

generalization of stepwise linear regression?

% Heuristics: Usage guidelines
% The heuristics element describe the commonsense, best practice, and demonstrated rules for applying and configuring a parameterized algorithm. The heuristics relate to the technical details of the techniques procedure and data structures for general classes of application (neither specific implementations not specific problem instances). The heuristics are described textually, such as a series of guidelines in a bullet-point structure.
\subsection{Heuristics}
% What are the suggested configurations for a technique?
% What are the guidelines for the application of a technique to a problem instance?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Friedman originally proposed it a suitable technique for sample sizes $50 \leq N \leq 1000$ and dimensions $3 \leq n \leq 20$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code Listing}
% listing
Listing~\ref{earth_multivariate_adaptive_regression_splines} provides a code listing Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines method in R to find a line of best fit for a two-dimensional data set.
% algorithm and package
The example uses the {earth()} function in the \texttt{earth} package that uses a generalized linear model as the underling method.
% problem
The test problem is a two-dimensional dataset of 50 samples, where the x-values are drawn from a uniformly random distribution $x \in [0,10]$ and y values are the x value plus a value drawn from a normally random distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Mills provides an example using the \texttt{earth} package with sample output and plots of the model \cite{Mills2010}. Torgo also provides a small example if using the \texttt(earth) package \cite{Torgo2009}. 
% other package
Some other packages that provide an implementation of MARS include the \texttt{mda} package and the \texttt{polymars} package.


% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is suggested.
