% Name
% The algorithm name defines the canonical name used to refer to the technique, in addition to common aliases, abbreviations, and acronyms. The name is used in terms of the heading and sub-headings of an algorithm description.

\emph{Elastic-Net}

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
Elastic-Net is a Regularization algorithm.

extension of elastic-net


% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\subsection{Strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
% What is a techniques plan of action?


uses the LARS-EN algorithm

elastic net is a compromise between ridge regression and the lasso
combine the strengths of L2 regularization and L1 minimization
The elastic net is especially useful in the "large p small n setting," as is the case for microarray data

lambda is fit by cyclic coordinate descent (same in lasso?)

all about maximizing the appropriate penalized log-likelihood

% listing
Listing~\ref{glmnet_elastic_net} provides a code listing Elastic Net method in R.
% algorithm and package
The example uses the \texttt{glmnet()} function in the \texttt{glmnet} core package. The demonstration provides an example of a logistic regression with regularization.

% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is suggested.
