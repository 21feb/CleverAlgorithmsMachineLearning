% other names
% What is the canonical name and common aliases for a technique?
% What are the common abbreviations and acronyms for a technique?
\emph{Classification And Regression Tree, CART.}

% Taxonomy: Lineage and locality
% The algorithm taxonomy defines where a techniques fits into the field, both the specific subfields of Computational Intelligence and Biologically Inspired Computation as well as the broader field of Artificial Intelligence. The taxonomy also provides a context for determining the relation- ships between algorithms. The taxonomy may be described in terms of a series of relationship statements or pictorially as a venn diagram or a graph with hierarchical structure.
\subsection{Taxonomy}
% To what fields of study does a technique belong?
% What are the closely related approaches to a technique?
The Classification And Regression Tree or CART is a Decision Tree algorithm. CART is a registered trademark.

% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\subsection{Strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
% What is a techniques plan of action?
A textual description of the information processing strategy.

\subsection{Code Listing}
% listing
Listing~\ref{rpart_cart} provides a code listing of the CART method in R to classify examples from a three-dimensional dataset.
% algorithm and package
The example uses the \texttt{rpart()} function (recursive partitioning) in the \texttt{rpart} package \cite{Meyer2011}.
% TODO more about the package and the functions capabilities

% problem
The test problem is a three-dimensional classification problem, where the $x$ and $y$ attributes are numerical and drawn from normal distributions around 0 and 4. A class value of 0 or 1 is assigned to each coordinate such that the two classes can be separated by a straight line. The dataset is split into a training set to make the model comprised of 67\% of the samples, and a test set for assessing the model comprised of 33\% of the samples.

% TODO provide prediction example

% other packages
Other packages provide implementations of the CART method, such as the \texttt{tree} package.
