% Model Verification
\section{Model Verification} 
\label{advanced:verification}
\index{Verification}

a section on verifying models
- split tests
- cross validation
- recall, precision, confusion matricies
- reliability diagrams
- ROC curves


% Methodology (?)
\subsection{Methodology}
Getting started on an data problem can be difficult, in not parallizing. What algorithm to use, what process to follow. This section gives some guidelines that may help 


Methodology: (Andrew Ng)
prepare model on test set
select parameters on the validation set
test on the test set

use learning curves to diagnose bias/variance problems


Approach (andrew ng)
- Brainstorm and generate lots of approaches to the problem - sample each to get an idea of where to spend time...
- try simple algorithms first - something quick and dirty
- plot learning curves
	- avoid premature optimization (use evidence to guide project)
- perform error analysis
	- manually examine errors
	- look for systematic patterns in mis-classified instances
