a section about plotting data in R
libraries one could use
plots that might be useful
data exploration
results 
etc

could this be rolled into a data exploration section?

\subsection{Saving Plots}
% graphic devices...
Plots can be saved to disk in many different formats.

The following listing provides an example of saving a scatter plot in PNG format to the working directory using the \texttt{png()} function from the \texttt{grDevices} core package. For more information on the function type \texttt{?png}. Other functions that may be useful include \texttt{bmp()}, \texttt{jpeg()}, \texttt{tiff()}, and \texttt{pdf()}.

\begin{lstlisting}
# save a PNG of plot to the home directory as sample_plot.png
png('sample_plot.png')
# your plotting code goes here, here is a scatter plot
plot(rnorm(100),rnorm(100))
# turn off writing to file
dev.off()
\end{lstlisting}
