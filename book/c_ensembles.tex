\index{Ensembles}

\section{Overview}
This chapter describes Ensembles methods.


% Heuristics: Usage guidelines
% The heuristics element describe the commonsense, best practice, and demonstrated rules for applying and configuring a parameterized algorithm. The heuristics relate to the technical details of the techniques procedure and data structures for general classes of application (neither specific implementations not specific problem instances). The heuristics are described textually, such as a series of guidelines in a bullet-point structure.
\subsection{Heuristics}
% What are the suggested configurations for a technique?
% What are the guidelines for the application of a technique to a problem instance?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Many weak learners can out-perform a single strong learner.
	\item The diversity of the ensemble set is important property of success.
	\item There is now theory on why ensembles work (performing a Monte Carlo simulation for an integration problem).
\end{itemize}
