what is the description pattern?


R is an an open source environment for statistical programming and visualization. A strength of the platform is the large number of third party libraries available. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) provides access to these third party libraries, and one perspective on these libraries is specific tasks or roles, such as machine learning.
