\section{Overview}
This chapter describes Optimization methods.


% Strategy: Problem solving plan
% The strategy is an abstract description of the computational model. The strategy describes the information processing actions a technique shall take in order to achieve an objective. The strategy provides a logical separation between a computational realization (procedure) and a analogous system (metaphor). A given problem solving strategy may be realized as one of a number specific algorithms or problem solving systems. The strategy description is textual using information processing and algorithmic terminology.
\subsection{Strategy}
% What is the information processing objective of a technique?
% What is a techniques plan of action?

classical optimization methods used in machine learning algorithms

numerical methods for optimization convex functions


\subsection{Loss Functions}
optimization is typically about cost functions, in ML, it's about loss functions 
give examples of loss functions.



% Heuristics: Usage guidelines
% The heuristics element describe the commonsense, best practice, and demonstrated rules for applying and configuring a parameterized algorithm. The heuristics relate to the technical details of the techniques procedure and data structures for general classes of application (neither specific implementations not specific problem instances). The heuristics are described textually, such as a series of guidelines in a bullet-point structure.
\subsection{Heuristics}
% What are the suggested configurations for a technique?
% What are the guidelines for the application of a technique to a problem instance?

\begin{itemize}
	\item 
\end{itemize}


advanced numerical methods
simple ones require a learning rate
more advanced methods use a line search to find a good alpha each iteration
beyond gradient descent are a lot more complex



% References: Deeper understanding
% The references element description includes a listing of both primary sources of information about the technique as well as useful introductory sources for novices to gain a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the technique. The description consists of hand-selected reference material including books, peer reviewed conference papers, journal articles, and potentially websites. A bullet-pointed structure is suggested.
