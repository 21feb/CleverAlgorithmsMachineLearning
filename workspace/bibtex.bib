  abstract = {{Function approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical

	is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest--descent
	minimization. A general gradient--descent \&amp;quot;boosting\&amp;quot;
	paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting
	criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least--squares,
	least--absolute--deviation, and Huber--M loss functions for regression,
	and multi--class logistic likelihood for classification. Special
	enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual
	additive components are decision trees, and tools for interpreting
	such \&amp;quot;TreeBoost \&amp;quot; models are presented. Gradient
	boosting of decision trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable
	procedures for regression and classification, especially appropriate
	for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach
	and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire 1996, and Friedman,

	of events per variable (EPV) analyzed in logistic regression analysis.
	The simulations were based on data from a cardiac trial of 673 patients
	in which 252 deaths occurred and seven variables were cogent predictors
	of mortality; the number of events per predictive variable was ()
	for the full sample. For the simulations, at values of EPV = 2, 5,
	10, 15, 20, and 25, we randomly generated 500 samples of the 673
	patients, chosen with replacement, according to a logistic model
	derived from the full sample. Simulation results for the regression
	coefficients for each variable in each group of 500 samples were
	compared for bias, precision, and significance testing against the
	results of the model fitted to the original sample. For EPV values
	of 10 or greater, no major problems occurred. For EPV values less
	than 10, however, the regression coefficients were biased in both
	positive and negative directions; the large sample variance estimates
	from the logistic model both overestimated and underestimated the
	sample variance of the regression coeffi-cients; the 90\% confidence
	limits about the estimated values did not have proper coverage; the
	Wald statistic was conservative under the null hypothesis; and paradoxical
	associations (significance in the wrong direction) were increased.
	Although other factors (such as the total number of events, or sample
	size) may influence the validity of the logistic model, our findings
	indicate that low EPV can lead to major problems.}},

	models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge
	regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent

  abstract = {{Summary * 1The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression
	are well established within the statistical literature. However,
	an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological
	and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique
	remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach
	was used, 57\% of studies used a stepwise procedure. * 2The principal
	drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter
	estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an
	inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing,
	and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We
	discuss each of these issues with examples. * 3We use a worked example
	of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight
	the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression
	allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from
	each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models,
	they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are
	at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data
	set. * 4An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer
	data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses
	arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of
	competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing
	that no one model should be relied upon for inference.}},
