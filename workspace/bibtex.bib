  title = {{Greedy function approximation: A gradient boosting machine}},
  journal = {Annals of Statistics},
  year = {2001},
  volume = {29},
  pages = {1189--1232},
  abstract = {{Function approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical
	optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection
	is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest--descent
	minimization. A general gradient--descent \&amp;quot;boosting\&amp;quot;
	paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting
	criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least--squares,
	least--absolute--deviation, and Huber--M loss functions for regression,
	and multi--class logistic likelihood for classification. Special
	enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual
	additive components are decision trees, and tools for interpreting
	such \&amp;quot;TreeBoost \&amp;quot; models are presented. Gradient
	boosting of decision trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable
	procedures for regression and classification, especially appropriate
	for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach
	and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire 1996, and Friedman,
	Hastie, and Tibshirani 1998 are discussed.}},
